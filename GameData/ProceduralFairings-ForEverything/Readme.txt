Installation
***Requires*** Procedural Fairings, Firespitter core (the dll), and Module Manager. These are not bundled, so be sure you get them (or install via CKAN).

Known Issues

    Procedural Fairings cannot place the "top" node below the fairing start point. KW Expanded Fairings place the payload above the structure. Use the stock offset tool to place the payload onto the structure.
    Some of the interstage node placements don't scale well with the interstage model, you may see some clipping. Again, can fix with the stock offset tool.
