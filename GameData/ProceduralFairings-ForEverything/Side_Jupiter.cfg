    @description = This fairing is designed with a more curved shape for the Jupiter craft.  The blunted nose provides a better drag profile at lower velocities, and is thus suited for a steeper ascent, where the atmosphere quickly becomes a minimal design factor.  The engineers ran the calculations to see how steep the ascent would have to be before they didn't have to design any fairings.  The budget office laughed at their design proposal.
