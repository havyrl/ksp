description = Designed for long term storage of up to 4 Kerbals. The CRY-5000 uses Glykerol and ElectricCharge to freeze or thaw one Kerbal.
Please ensure you have enough ElectricCharge capacity on your base. The CRY-5000 comes stocked with 50 units of Glykerol.
CAUTION: The CRY-5000 also requires ElectricCharge per minute per Kerbal to keep it's Monitoring Systems Functioning. If it cannot get this ElectricCharge 
there is a risk of frozen Kerbals dying.
