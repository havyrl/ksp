    description = This module for assisted landing is a successor of the K&K Planetary Adapter. It was developed together with Rockomax who managed to fit two supercharged 48-7S "Spark" engines into the structure. Engineers were able to double the performance of the engines be replacing the turbopump with the one they "borrowed" from the LT-T30. They say that the chances for a critical overheating just slightly increased.
