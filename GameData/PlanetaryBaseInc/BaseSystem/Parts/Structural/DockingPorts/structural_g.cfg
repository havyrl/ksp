    description = The adapter was developed after several failed attempts to land a base on another planet. Engineers at K&K found out that the missing ability to add landing legs on many of the planetary modules led to a too hard impact. This adapter allows to add this components to a base. It also has a limited capability for rocket fuel as a bonus.
