0.33.3 - 2016.02.03
-------------------
Reset default life support options to 'grouchiness'

0.33.2 - 2016.02.02
-------------------

Added a probe core to the Light Globe part (to prevent it being culled)
Added an OKS version of the inflatable workshop (texture decal is temporary)

0.33.0 - 2016.02.01
-------------------
Planetary Logistics is now available.  This allows shared storage and retrieval of resources via the large MKS ILMs.  This is surface only.
Kolonization Rewards are now available.  Active MKS colonies will now automatically provide funds, rep, and science based on the corresponding number of engineers, pilots, and scientists in your base and in MKS-enabled modules.
Koloniation Bonuses are now available.  Visible via the new Kolonization icon, the longer your crew are on a planet (or in orbit, but at a reduced point), the further along kolonization will proceed.
- Engineers grant bonuses to drills and engineering-based converters.
- Scientitst grant bonuses to greenhouses and science-based converters.
- Pilots grant a global habitation bonus (USI-LS only).
Hydrates, Gypsum, and Dirt have been added to kontainers, and the RocketParts texture has been replaced with one for MaterialKits.

All Duna-class and Mark III modules are automatically power couplers (less parts!)
Fixed a typo in the landing stabilizer's name
Optimized the Duna-class model for some slight perf increases
Added a probe core with EC usage to the anchor hub
Reduced hab wear rate by 90%


0.32.2 - 2016.01.20
-------------------
Updated TAC-LS configs to swap out USI-LS recyclers and fix an issue with the OKS Ag Module (Thanks jd284!)
Fixed issue where negative supply values were not displaying.
Wear and tear is disabled by default unless a mod opts to have it on.  The multiplier for this is also now included in the bundled configs.
Corrected a typo on the Sunflower lighting kit
Made OKS Ag Module resources visible in the VAB
Removed extra texture that was causing some issues with the liquid tanks (round, cylinder, and saddle)
Made salvaging have the same SpecializedParts ratio as those required by Extraplanetary Launchpads for ship construction
Fixed issues with the EL config that resulted in RocketParts still being required.  
the refinery no longer produces RareMetals and ExoticMinerals as byproducts, these can now be directly mined.
A new module, the Industrial Regolith Sifter, has been added.  This module can take Dirt and extract small quantities of all resources found on a planet.  It can also creat Fertilizer from Gypsum, and Water from Hydrates.  
A new drill capable of extracting Hydrates, Gypsum, and Dirt has been added.
The Kerbitat's Life Support recycler has been replaced with a Water Purifier.  When provided with water, it acts as a 90% Life Support recycler for USI-LS, making it the best one available.
The PDU no longer has the breeder and centrifuge functions
The larger ILMs now act as warehouses for Planetary Logistics.
The smaller ISMs now act as Distribution Warehouses.
Crew no longer need to be present inside of an MKS or OKS ag module for it to function at top efficiency.  Their efficiency caps have also been removed.
All Duna modules, Mk-III modules, and the Scout command pod have built in power couplers.

0.32.1 - 2016.01.19
--------------------
Updated archive to include missing files

0.32.0.0 - 2016.01.18
---------------------
Added USI-LS habitation support to relevant modules. 
Added several new components to aid in base setup:
- A portable light kit
- Landing stabilizers
- A retractable sky crane
- Inflatable fuel tanks (with option to jettison contents)
- A small caster wheel to aid in moving modules 
Updated various shared components
Fixed several cost discrepancies (thanks fat-lobyte!)
Added a small starter reactor to the MKS PDU
Removed the MKS and OKS legacy PDUs
There has been a major cleanup of the logistics logic.  Older mechanics have been consolidated or replaced with Scavanging, Power Distribution, Resource Distribution, and Distributed Warehouses.  See the forum thread for details.
All logistics logic has been moved over to USITools so it can be shared with some of the other non-core mods.
Default logistics times are 5 seconds for resources and power, and 10 seconds for warehouse distribution
MKS-Lite will not be shown if UKS is installed.
The shared Kolonization DLL and associated configs has been moved to make sharing it easier.
UKS now installs in a 'UKS' folder - separate from Kolonization.  This will make sharing the core colony stuff a bit easier.
Efficiency now updates when you move crew - no need to restart converters.
Deprecated Tweakscale support
Cleaned up a few assets
The PDU and Fuel Refinery now allow their EnrichedUranium to be transferred out during maintenance, and will try to pull in DepletedFuel for their fuel recyclers.
The saddle tank has had it's mass reduced from 0.4 to 0.15 tons
When Extraplanetary Launchpads is present, RocketParts are replaced by a combination of SpecializedParts and MaterialKits in the resource chain.
When USI-LS is used, recyclers and habitation rules are in effect.  Supply consumption is also drastically increased.  Penalties for EVA loss and starvation have also been increased.  You can alter these by changing USI-LS.cfg in the Kolonization folder.
Inflatables now set to no crew capacity when deflated.  You cannot deflate a module that contains Kerbals.
Module/Mobile bases have had their KIS storage reduced to 2500.  No more bags of holding.
Inflatables have had their KIS volume trimmed from 1250 to 1000 to make using KIS storage boxes easier
Hab modules, Ag modules, and the Scout lander pod act as basic life support recyclers.
Aeroponic and Kerbitat modules act as advanced life support recyclers.
The Pioneer module comes with a colony-grade life support recycler.
Note that all life support recyclers have cumulative effects - it's always good to add more, and there is no penalty for mixing types.
Habs can be repaired via the perform maintenance option.  This requires MaterialKits.
Organics have been deprecated.  All converters now go straight to supplies.
The Kerbitat now serves as the best Habitation Multiplier for USI_LS, and a mid-range recycler.  
The Pioneer Module now serves as the best life support recycler, and also acts as a resource distributor for resource logistics (if a pilot is on board).
The Aeroponics Module has been trimmed down to a single module (cultivation), allowing for the conversion of substrate, water, and fertilizer directly into supplies.  It also includes some habitat bonuses (plants are good!) and a mid-range life support recycler.
The MKS and OKS Agriculture Modules now only have the Agroponics Module (Mulch+Fertilizer=Supplies).  Organics are depredated.  Also includes a basic life support recycler, and still works as efficiency parts for the aeroponics modules.
The MKS and OKS Hab Module/Hab Ring no longer has a converter, but instead works to extend the habitation capacity of your base.
A rudimentary TAC-LS config is included.  This config is probably wrong.  Hopefully someone with more TAC-LS experience can send a pull request :)
Inflatable Ag Modules now have crew capacity, so you can transfer crew to work in them.  Also, for best efficiency in agriculture modules, use a Scientist not an Engineer (though Engineers are a decent second choice).
Fixed the top node of the Duna class colony modules
De-bundled all of the core dependencies - these are now bundled with the Kolonization parent mod.  This should make MKS-specific updates a lot easier to download.

----------------------
From jberkman:
- Moved 6 way anchor hub to correct CTT node

From Seb E:
- Fixed issue with efficiency part as root part
From Jberkman
- Fixed several typos 
Other changes:

Added a handy KIS 'saddle bag' to Kontainers, hods 500L
Converted Kontainer images to DDS
Added alternate nodes to the rigid tube to better connect with ball hubs, etc.
Added a new anchor hub - this small hub is KIS storable, can be anchored to the ground, and works very well if you want to make a base with 100% KIS components (this would be your root part)
Adjusted the regolith sifter - the resource threshold has been removed at the expense of efficiency, making this a much more viable first harvesting part.
Adjusted several colliders to add a bit more leeway for ground contact
Added 6-way station hub (thanks Enceos!)



0.31.9 - 2015.09.21
-------------------
Adjusted Duna Module collider to allow for easier selection of crew hatch

- Minor fix to the description of MK3 refinery

From mhoram:
- Fix small issues with rover logistics
- Add ModuleFieldRepair to nukes to enable Maintenance

And other fixes!
- Corected hatches and colliders on MKS Module
- Fixed ModuleBase feet
- Fixed missing light animations for inflatable parts
- Added light emmissive to docking port
- Changed demo block's context menus to avoid confusion
- Added box collider to the bubble hub
- Reduced drill mass to be inline with stock
- The Akademy is now a lot heavier - 6.5 tons - since most modules get their weight from added machinery.
- Separated senders and receivers for power generation.  A PowerDistributor can distribute power via a PowerCoupler.  Both have separate ranges and can be on the same part.
- The Power pack is a short range PowerDistributor and PowerCoupler.  So it can power up devices within 500m.
- The (new) PDU also has both PowerDistributor and PowerCoupler capabilities, but has a very long distribution range (15km).  PDUs should be the 'Hub' in a hub and spoke base design.  It als takes on the centrifuge and breeder functions of the fuel refinery.
- THE MKS AND OKS PDU MODULES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED LEGACY AND WILL BE DEPRECATED WITH KSP 1.1
- Separated logistics from MKS efficiency, so you can now easily have parts that are not MKS modules subscribe to rover logistics and power distribution.  This module is added to all MKS modules and stock drills.

0.31.7 - 2015.09.17
-------------------
First off - a ton of community fixes in this one.  Thanks so much for helping out!

- Added alternate configs for OSE Workshop that utilizes MKS style chains, and adds workshop capabilities to both the Mk-V and Mk-III workshops.
- The Logistics Rover now has emissive effects
- The original Mk-II Aeroponics, Kerbitat, and Pioneer modules have been replaced by the slick new 'Duna' series modules (I'll be deprecating the Mk-x designations over time because they are a bit confusing).  This newer module is meant to stack in-line with the Karibou, or be used *without* a module base.  The radial nodes are dual-sized, one for connecting to other parts, and an inset node for accepting Mk-V modules.  The Duna series modules can be put in a 3.75m fairing either horizontally or vertically!  This module also has dual flag transforms, and the floodlights (four light sources) have been replaced with a single light source to help reduce lag.
- The Bahamuto style drills have been replaced with reskinned stock drills.  NOTE!!! THIS WILL CAUSE SHIPS WITH THE OLD DRILLS TO LEAP INTO THE AIR!!! DETACH OLD DRILLS OR HILARITY MAY ENSUE!
- All of the MK-V inflatables now light up!
- Modified the Module and Mobile base parts to be compatible with the Duna series modules.
