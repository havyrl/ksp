Space is now automatically expanded as resources are removed.
The Jaw now operates as a high efficiency drill
Asteroids are significantly more massive (up to four times larger, and 33 times denser).
To cope with this, the Mass Driver engine has been increased in size, and is now a 2.5m
There is also a 1.25m mass driver RCS version, with significant thrust (runs on rock and EC)
