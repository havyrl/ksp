	description = The Karman line is the line at which the speed necessary to maintain altitude via lift is the same as the speed required for orbit. It's the traditional dividing line between the atmosphere and space (despite there being nonzero pressure well above it; Earth's atmosphere extends quite far indeed). We want you to send something above it!
