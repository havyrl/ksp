		RESULTS
		{
			default = An accurate reading of the local magnetic field is recorded.
			default = Local variations in the magnetic field are detected.
			KerbinInSpaceLow = Initial scans indicate a large magnetic field surrounding Kerbin, its intensity decreases with increasing altitude.
			KerbinInSpaceHigh = Kerbin's magnetic field spans several planetary radii, protecting its atmosphere from the solar wind and cosmic radiation.
			KerbinInSpaceHigh = Interactions with the solar wind significantly distort Kerbin's magnetic field, resulting in a compressed field on Kerbin's solar side, and a tapered tail on the opposite side.
			KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The magnetometer is properly calibrated and records Kerbin's surface level magnetic field.
			KerbinSrfLanded = The magnetometer records an accurate reading of Kerbin's surface magnetic field.
			KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The magnetic field lines near the pole are almost directly vertical relative to the surface, indicating that Kerbin's magnetic poles are closely aligned with its geographic poles.
			KerbinSrfLandedMountains = A strong magnetic field suggests that you may have stumbled upon one of Kerbin's mythic "magnetic mountains".
			KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = Strong local magnetic fields are detected in this area, suggesting high concentrations of magnetically active elements.
			KerbinSrfLandedRunway = For some reason the magnetic field lines are continuously changing directions; it's almost as if someone is running in circles around the runway with a giant magnet.
			KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = The magnetometer provides a decent approximation of this flag pole; all that's left is to climb to the top and hang a flag.
			KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = The enormous radio dishes block out Kerbin's natural magnetic field.
			KerbinSrfLandedVAB = Wouldn't it make more sense to have taken readings from the VAB before launch?
			KerbinSrfLandedVABMainBuilding = Now is this really necessary?
			KerbinSrfLandedR&D = Maybe someone else should be taking reading from the R&D center...
			KerbinSrfLandedR&DTanks = OK, really now, let's go somewhere interesting to take magnetometer readings...
			KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = Pointing this magnetometer at the Admin building might not make the bosses too happy.
			KerbinSrfLandedAstronautComplex = Those astronauts sure are missing out on this grand adventure...
			KerbinSrfLandedSPH = The tower controllers are not amused...
			KerbinSrfLandedSPHRoundTank = Nothing better to do?
			KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = Mission Control confirms that this is indeed a waste of time.
			MunInSpaceHigh = A weak magnetic field indicates that the Mun may once have contained a molten iron core.
			MunInSpaceLow = Localized magnetic fields are detected over several regions of the Mun's surface.
			MunSrfLanded = A very faint magnetic field is detected on the Mun's surface.
			MunSrfLandedNorthernBasin = A weak magnetic field is detected in this region. The absence of large craters nearby suggests that this crustal magnetization is left over from the Mun's once molten core.
			MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = Strong magnetic fields are detected in the base of the crater, likely arising from magnetically aligned ejecta from a large impactor.
			MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = A strong magnetic field is detected in the deeper regions of this crater.
			MunSrfLandedEastFarsideCrater = An intense magnetic field is detected in this crater, possibly originating in material from the meteorite that impacted here.
			MunSrfLandedPoles = Magnetic field strength remains at baseline levels for the Mun's surface, indicating that no further geodynamo activity occurs in the Mun's core.
			MinmusInSpace = Frozen ice cream doesn't emit a magnetic field dummy.
			MinmusSrfLanded = Closer study reveals that Minmus does indeed not generate a magnetic field.
			MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = Even Minmus' minty-looking frozen surface is magnetically dead.
			MinmusSrfLandedLesserFlats = The readout is flat, like the frozen surface.
			SunInSpaceLow = Sensors overloading... oh dear, I think the boom is melting.
			SunInSpaceHigh = Kerbol's enormous magnetosphere extends well beyond the orbit Eeloo, affecting all of the planets in the solar system.
			MohoInSpace = Scans indicate only a weak induced magnetic field, this is most likely caused by the stream of charged particles in the solar wind flowing around Moho.
			MohoSrfLanded = Low surface level magnetic fields reflect Moho's lack of any internally generated magnetosphere.
			EveInSpaceLow = Intense magnetic fields nearly overload the sensors.
			EveInSpaceHigh = A strong magnetic field ensures that Eve's atmosphere remains protected from Kerbol's radiation.
			EveSrfLanded = Surface level magnetism is slightly lower than that measured in orbit; Eve's strong ring current may be responsible for shielding the surface from some of its magnetic field.
			GillyInSpace = Gilly appears to be nothing more than loosely held together rocks with no detectable magnetic field.
			GillySrfLanded = No magnetic field is detected on Gilly's surface.
			DunaInSpaceLow = Isolated patches of Duna's atmosphere appear to be protected by small magnetospheres.
			DunaInSpaceHigh = A very weak magnetic field indicates that Duna's core solidified long ago, allowing its atmosphere to be largely stripped away and blasting the surface with intense solar radiation.
			DunaSrfLanded = Surface level magnetic field lines suggest the presence of several small, but powerful magnetic anomalies.
			IkeInSpace = Cold, dead, lifeless, no readings of interest here.
			IkeSrfLanded = Ike appears as magnetically boring on the surface as it did from orbit.
			DresInSpace = Who comes to Dres?
			DresSrfLanded = Were you expecting something different on the surface?
			JoolInSpaceLow = Jool's strong magnetic field traps belts of powerful radiation; observe caution in low orbits. Conditions could prove hazardous for Kerbaled crafts.
			JoolInSpaceHigh = Jool's enormous magnetosphere extends well beyond the orbit of all its moons in every direction.
			LaytheInSpace = Laythe generates its own magnetic field, indicating a molten core and an active geology. The field is strongly influenced by Jool's much larger magnetosphere.
			LaytheSrfLanded = A surface level magnetic field is detected on Laythe, with field lines indicating that the magnetic poles are located far away from the geographic poles.
			VallInSpaceHigh = Only Jool's magnetic field is detectable here, suggesting that Vall lacks any geodynamo activity.
			VallInSpaceLow = A very weak magnetic field is detected in low orbit of Vall. This is perhaps due to Vall's mysteriously liquid, sub-surface oceans.
			VallSrfLanded = Weak surface level magnetic fields are detected, possibly caused by sub-surface water flow.
			TyloInSpace = Tylo doesn't appear to generate its own magnetic field, but strongly distorts Jool's field, indicating a high concentration of dense, magnetic elements.
			TyloSrfLanded = Strong surface level magnetic fields are detected, but little consistency in direction is observed.
			BopInSpaceHigh = Bop produces an intensely powerful magnetosphere; much further study is warranted...
			BopInSpaceLow = Bop's magnetic field appears very uneven, localized primarily in the northern polar region; further study is warranted...
			BopSrfLanded = All magnetic field lines point north, indicating a small, but intensely powerful source of magnetism somewhere near the north pole.
			PolInSpace = Like a grain of pollen blowing in Jool's magnetic wind.
			PolSrfLanded = Only Jool's magnetic field is detectable on Pol's surface.
			EelooInSpace = Eeloo appears cold and lifeless. Only Kerbol's weak magnetic field is detectable from here.
			EelooSrfLanded = No significant magnetic field is detected on Eeloo's surface.
			AblateInSpace = A significant induced magnetosphere causes a noticeable distortion in Kerbol's much larger field.
			AscensionInSpace = There is little to no detectable magnetic field beyond the background levels here.
			ErinInSpace = Erin's ionosphere and a band of charged particles are likely responsible for the weak magnetic field detected here.
			InaccessableInSpace = The rapid rotation of this planetoid creates a constantly shifting magnetic field.
			JokerInSpace = A weak magnetic field is detected around Joker, likely induced by nearby Serious.
			PockInSpace = Nothing beyond Erin's magnetic field is detected here.
			RingleInSpace = The moon itself doesn't appear to generate any magnetic field, but a weak signal is detected in close proximity to the ring system.
			SentarInSpace = Sentar generates an intense magnetic field, likely trapping several bands of dangerous, charged particles in its ring system.
			SeriousInSpace = Serious generates a significant magnetic field that interacts with the remnants of Kerbol's much larger field.
			SkeltonInSpace = Skelton's high inclination generates an interesting interaction with Sentar's strong magnetic field as it passes above and below it.
			ThudInSpace = A fairly strong magnetic field is detected around Thud, suggesting the possibility of a dense, iron-rich core.
			SarnusInSpaceLow = The magnetic field around Sarnus is distorted by the ring particles orbiting its equatorial belt.
			SarnusInSpaceHigh = Distortions in Sarnus' magnetosphere are detected around some if its moons, particularly Eeloo and Tekto, as they add plasma into the system.
			HaleInSpace = This tiny moonlet produces little more than a blip in the larger magnetic field of Sarnus.

				settingsHelpResetPlanetData = Resets all SCANsat data for the current celestial body.\nA confirmation window will open before activating.\nCannot be reversed.
				settingsHelpResetAllData = Resets all SCANsat data for all celestial bodies.       \nA confirmation window will open before activating.\nCannot be reversed.
				settingsHelpVesselsSensorsPasses = Information about the currently active SCANsat sensors. Vessels indicates the number of vessels with active sensors. Sensors indicates the total number of sensors; instruments with multiple sensor types count each individual sensor. Passes indicates the number of sensor updates performed per second.\nThis value is affected by the\nTimeWarp Resolution setting.
				settingsHelpGreyScale = Use a true grey-scale color spectrum for black-and-white SCANsat maps. Pixels on the altitude map will interpolate between black and white; the min and max terrain heights for each celestial body\ndefine the limits.
				settingsHelpExportCSV = Export a .csv file along with map texture when using the Export button on the big map. The file contains coordinates and the terrain height for each pixel. Pixels are labeled from left to right\nand from top to bottom.
				settingsHelpSetMapWidth = Enter an exact value for the SCANsat big map texture width. Values are limited to 550 - 8192 pixels wide. Press the Set button to apply the value.
				settingsHelpWindowScale = Adjust all SCANsat window scales; buttons adjust scale in increments of 5%.
				resourceSettingsHelpOverlayWindow = Open the planetary overlay map control window.
				resourceSettingsHelpBiomeLock = Circumvents the requirement for stock surface biome scans. SCANsat displays will show the full accuracy for resource abundance with or without any surface biome scans.
				resourceSettingsHelpInstant = By default, the stock M700 resource scanner's orbital survey will fill in all SCANsat resource maps. This can be disabled, requiring standard SCANsat methods for all resource scanning. Disabled automatically when stock resource scanning is disabled.
				resourceSettingsHelpNarrowBand = Numerous SCANsat functions require a Narrow-Band resource scanner on-board the current vessel or in orbit of a celestial body for fully accurate resource abundance data.\nDisable this to circumvent these restrictions.
				resourceSettingsHelpDisableStock = Disables all stock resource scanning functions. SCANsat scanning methods will be required for all resource data. Replaces several stock resource functions with SCANsat tools. These include The right-click readouts, the high resolution narrow-band scanner map, and the planetary overlay maps.
				resourceSettingsHelpResetSCANsatResource = Resets all SCANsat resource data for the current celestial body. Other SCANsat data is not affected.\nA confirmation window will open before activating.\nCannot be reversed.
				resourceSettingsHelpResetStockResource = Resets the stock resource scanning coverage for the current celestial body. A reload or scene change may be required for all changes to take effect.\nA confirmation window will open before activating.\nCannot be reversed.
				resourceSettingsHelpOverlayInterpolation = Change the number of resource abundance measurements used in constructing the planetary overlay and big map resource overlay. Decrease the value to increase the accuracy of the map. Lower values will result in slower map generation.
				resourceSettingsHelpOverlayHeight = Change the texture size (map width is 2XHeight) used in constructing the planetary overlay and big map resource overlay. Increase the value to increase the quality and accuracy of the map. Higher values will result in slower map generation.
				resourceSettingsHelpOverlayBiomeHeight = Change the texture size (map width is 2XHeight) used in constructing the planetary overlay biome map. Increase the value to increase the quality and accuracy of the map. Higher values will result in slower map generation.
				resourceSettingsHelpOverlayTransparency = Create a grey background for planetary overlay resource maps. Used to make clear which sections of the celestial body have been\nscanned but contain no resources.
				resourceSettingsHelpScanThreshold = A threshold level used to apply the stock resource scan to a celestial body after scanning with SCANsat sensors. This is useful when contracts or other addons require that a stock resource scan be performed. Set a value from 0-100 in the text box and click on the Set button. All celestial bodies will be checked immediately; celestial bodies will also be checked upon loading or a scene change. A reload may be required for the changes to take effect.
				resourceSettingsModuleManagerWarning = Warning:\nModule Manager is required for all SCANsat resource scanning
				colorTerrainHelpMin = Defines the low altitude cutoff for the terrain color palette. Anything below this altitude will be shown with the lowest color.
				colorTerrainHelpMax = Defines the high altitude cutoff for the terrain color palette. Anything above this altitude will be shown with the highest color.
				colorTerrainHelpClampToggle = Used to define a cutoff between the low and high altitude values. This is particularly useful for ocean planets where it helps to define a sharp distinction between land and ocean.
				colorTerrainHelpClamp = Defines the clamp altitude cutoff. Anything below the cutoff will be represented by the first two colors in the selected color palette. Anything above the cutoff will be represented with the remaining colors.
				colorTerrainHelpReverse = Reverses the order of the currently\nselected color palette.
				colorTerrainHelpDiscrete = Draws the map using only the specific colors defined by each palette, instead of smoothly interpolating between them.
				colorTerrainHelpPaletteSize = Adjust the number of colors available in the currently selected color palette.
				colorBiomeHelpStock = Use the stock biome color scheme for\nSCANsat biome maps.
				colorBiomeHelpWhiteBorder = Draw a white border between biomes. Does not apply to the planetary overlay biome maps.
				colorBiomeHelpTransparency = Adjust the transparency of biome maps. Terrain elevation is shown behind the biome maps. Set to 0% to disable terrain drawing.
				colorPickerHelpLow = The top color swatch shows the updated color selection for the low end of this color spectrum. The bottom color swatch shows the currently active color.
				colorPickerHelpHigh = The top color swatch shows the updated color selection for the high end of this color spectrum. The bottom color swatch shows the currently active color.
				colorPickerHelpValue = This slider adjusts the Value (in HSV color terms) or Brightness for the currently selected color.
				colorResourceHelpFineControl = Activates Fine Control Mode where the sliders will only show values within 5% of the current selection.
				colorResourceHelpMin = The low cutoff for resource concentration on the selected celestial body. Resource deposits at this level will be displayed using the low end of the current resource overlay color spectrum. Resource deposits below this value will not be shown.
				colorResourceHelpMax = The high cutoff for resource concentration on the selected celestial body. Resource deposits above this value will be shown using the high end of the current resource overlay color spectrum.
				colorResourceHelpTransparency = Defines the level of transparency for resource overlays. Increase to allow more of the underlying terrain, slope, or biome map to be visible. This also affect the transparency of resource deposits on the planetary overlay resource map.
				colorResourceHelpApply = Applies the current values for the selected resource and celestial body only.
				colorResourceHelpApplyAll = Applies the current values for the selected resource for all celestial bodies.
				colorResourceHelpDefault = Reverts to the default values for the selected resource and celestial body only.
				colorResourceHelpDefaultAll = Reverts to the default values for the selected resource for all celestial bodies.
				colorHelpSaveToConfig = Save all color configuration values to the config file found in your SCANsat/Resources folder. These values serve as the defaults for new saves and for all Revert To Default buttons. Values do not need to be saved to the config file to be applied for this save file.
				colorSlopeHelpCutoff = Adjust the cutoff level between the two selected slope color pairs.

			default = Analyzed low resolution altimetry data.
			default = "RADAR Altimetry Sensor is reporting in. I don't know how, but we have a strong signal and are getting data. This calls for a celebratory round of snacks!"
			Sun = You wonder if the sensor is malfunctioning.
			Moho = Well, at least this low resolution data makes Moho look kind of cool. Not quite giant lakes of lava, but still cool.
			Eve = You contemplate the grainy, rough altitude estimates returned by the scanner and wish that you had sent the high resolution scanner instead. Oh well, it's a great reason to launch more rockets! (As if we really needed a reason anyway)
			Gilly = Your low resolution scanning confirms what you already knew: Gilly is just a lumpy rock floating in space. At least you don't have to strain your eyes looking at the report.
			Kerbin = Even this low resolution data of the planets surface is amazingly useful. You can't wait to deploy this technology on the Mun or beyond.
			Mun = The data shows broad, sweeping strokes of the landscape below. A high resolution scan would be more helpful, but you can probably find a suitable landing site using this data.
			Minmus = You grudgingly acknowledge that the guys over at the Kerbal Astronomical Society were right: Minmus really is a moon. You wouldn't have believed it if you hadn't seen the altimetry scan with your own eyes.
			Duna = This low resolution data is a bit grainy and distorted, but it will still be invaluable in searching for a proper landing site on Duna. Suddenly a long-term Duna mission just became a real prospect.
			Ike = As you pore over the data you are struck by how similar Ike appears to the Mun. You wonder about their comparative surface geology.
			Dres = Even with the low resolution scanner it is quite apparent that Dres has some prominent mountains. You can't wait for the resource scan results because you're sure "there's gold in them their hills".
			Jool = Altimetry, what altimetry? It's a gas giant for Kerbal's sake. Let's just pick a number at random and call it good.
			Laythe = The sensor seems unable to penetrate the water.
			Vall = Well, here it is: "The data you Vall been waiting for! Hahahahaha! Hahaha. Ha. Ha? What, SOMEONE has to find that funny."
			Tylo = You're still not sure what the view from the surface with Laythe, Vall, and Jool overhead would be like, but this data will sure help you find a landing site so that you can find out.
			Bop = Well, the low resolution altimetry data is in, and you decide to package it up and send it back to KSC. You just hope that there is enough juice left in the batteries to get it all sent and keep basic systems running at the same time.
			Pol = The low resolution scan confirms that Pol does indeed look like a giant pollen grain. Until you upgrade to a high resolution scan, and advance the field of electron microscopy, you will still be left with the question of how strong this resemblance truly is.
			Eeloo = The scientists back on Kerbin have been waiting for this data for a long time. No doubt there will be celebrations and snacks for all when it gets there.

			default = "The High Resolution Altimetry Scan definitely is better then the low resolution one. SCAN has once again proven their scanning skills."
			Sun = You realize that you could have saved some money if you had trusted the low resolution sensor in the first place.
			Moho = Finally, the awesomeness has returned to Moho! It may not be giant flowing rivers of lava, but this data is spectacular!
			Eve = The high resolution sensor cut through the hazy purple atmosphere well, and you are able to distinguish minute details on the surface. The scientists back at KSC will be relieved.
			Gilly = Even in super-high resolution Gilly somehow seems to be in low resolution. That is one seriously lumpy surface.
			Kerbin = You become mesmerised by all the colors in the data that the new high resolution technology provides. Suddenly Mission Control awakes you from your stupor, and you quickly wipe the drool from the corner of your mouth.
			Mun = "Hah! No more boring grey moon. Just look at all the colors in that scan! Now we can really pinpoint a prime landing site."
			Minmus = Wow, not only is Minmus real, it has some amazing topography! You can't wait to land in one of those flat areas.
			Duna = This high resolution data is amazing. You begin analyzing the hills and valleys, searching for the perfect landing spot.
			Ike = The data confirms the presence of large sloping hills and craters. Hopefully the analysts back at KSC can use this to find a suitable landing place.
			Dres = Those... are some serious mountains. You are glad to be analysing this data, rather than trying to climb up some of those hills.
			Jool = Even in high resolution there does not appear to be a surface on Jool. So much for that theory. At least we still have the grant money!
			Laythe = The map shows mostly negative heights. You consider draining Laythe just so you can climb its mountains.
			Vall = The data from the high resolution scanner confirms that the surface of Vall is, indeed, "crinkly". Guess Gene owes you fifty funds.
			Tylo = Tylo may have been the first of Jool's moons to be discovered, but this data makes it feel like you are discovering the moon for the first time.
			Bop = Wow, look at all those colors. You have no idea what all that data means, but you're sure that this high resolution data will impress everyone back at KSC.
			Pol = Even with this amount of high-quality data it is still difficult to find a suitable landing site. How the heck was this moon made, anyway?
			Eeloo = The cracks and fissures on the surface stand out in striking detail as you examine the data from the SAR Altimetry Sensor. Just look at all those potential landing sites.

			Sun = You are surprised by the lack of biometric data.
			Sun = you wonder why there are no poles visible on the biome map.
			Moho = As you pore through the data you wonder if you will find the elusive lava lake biome that so many scientists had speculated about.
			Eve = The intricately swirled lines of Eve's biome map remind you of lava lamps and tie dyed shirts. Man those were the days. Next spacecraft to Eve will have a mandatory disco ball!
			Gilly = Even with all that squinting those astronomers couldn't see the biomes here. Hah! Dumb astronomers! That's 1 point for science and 0 points for uhhhh... science.
			Kerbin = This biome data is truly astounding. You just hope that it is crumb-resistant, as you remember eating a particularly messy box of snacks the day that the sensor was installed.
			Mun = Huh, never knew the moon had biomes. Wonder which one the cheese is in. And if there are any other snacks there as well.
			Minmus = You contemplate how fitting the name "Greater Flats" is as you pore over the data. Whoever thinks up these names is one smart Kerbal, unlike the engineers we have around here.
			Duna = You comb through the biome data looking for just the right spot to gather all that sweet, sweet science data from. Mmmmm, science... and snacks.
			Ike = As you pore over the data coming back from Ike you are surprised at the biome diversity. After all it's just a moon. You can't wait to get your hands on some of the scientific data locked up down there.
			Dres = Poles, check. Highlands, check. Midlands, check. Lowlands, check. Ridges, check. Impact Ejecta, check. Impact Craters, check. Canyons, check. I think we got it all. Time to shut down the scanner and have some snacks!
			Jool = You are surprised by the lack of biometric data.
			Jool = you wonder why there are no poles visible on the biome map.
			Laythe = You want to throw a party every time the sensor detects a land biome.
			Vall = Pretty straightforward data: Poles, Highlands, Midlands, and Lowlands. That's a wrap. Now let's have some snacks!
			Tylo = You are struck by the diversity of the biomes in the report. Not only is Tylo cool to look up from, it's cool to look down at too.
			Bop = This detailed analysis of Bop's biomes will advance our understanding of the little moon beyond anything we could have hoped. It's been a great day. Snacks all around!
			Pol = As you take in the biome data coming from Pol you begin to contemplate the possibility that pollen grains have biomes too. Then you quickly squash the thought, knowing what the activists would be like if they got a hold of that idea.
			Eeloo = It is astounding to have such detailed biome data on a planet so far from Kerbin. You gaze in awe at the report as the data comes in.

			Gilly = Initial resource scans of Gilly look interesting; it's almost like asteroid mining.
			Kerbin = We finally have some data about resources on Kerbin, because, as everyone knows, if you want basic information about your own planet nothing beats sending an expensive, complicated satellite into orbit.

			Dres = We might as well just search some of the nearby asteroids for resources; who would ever want to bother with Dres.
			Jool = Hmm, maybe a gas giant isn't the best place to go looking for surface resources...
			Laythe = Well, there's lots of good data here, but precious little area on the surface where we might actually be able to land and take advantage of the resources.

Despite valiant efforts from their representatives, however, they haven't quite been able to shake off the bad press that followed some leaked footage of an incident involving one of their units and a small critter that one of the scientists over at R&D used to keep as a pet. Some say the incident has made them extremely concerned with the safety of anything that approach their products. They've even rounded out the edges on their company logo.

Their flagship product, the FTX-2 Fuel Duct, is the final result of years of research and development and endless Kerbal-hours of effort to produce a device that will pump any amount of just about anything, no matter how cold, dense or volatile it is. The company enjoys a well-deserved reputation for such an important contribution to the industry, and most agree that these days, almost nobody remembers the embarrassment of their recall of the FTX-1 series, which had a small but highly problematic issue, that while it did pump fluids flawlessly, it pumped them in the wrong direction.

Their first product was the very massive Mobile Processing Lab, which rumour has it was first developed as a mobile processing facility to secretly brew an experimental, possibly illegal fuel mixture, which was reportedly far more potent than the currently available propellants, and had a distinctive blue tint to it. Those rumours have never been proven however, and this mysterious blue propellant has yet to be seen by a reliable source. Despite their repeated attempts to be rid of these rumours, the company still suffers from a (probably undeserved) bad reputation. They try to offset this initial impression by offering much larger cash payoffs than other companies of similar size, which admittedly does very little to improve their current image.

		description = After many years of research, STEADLER Corps rocket engineers discovered that large flywheels were necessary to keep large ships under control. The "Advanced Reaction Wheel Module, Large" addresses that issue by its use of patented Large Flywheels™ to provide "More Torque" (patent pending). STEADLER promptly dismissed all criticism concerning the necessity of so much research work, stating that 'it only sounds so simple now that we've figured it out'. Critics remain skeptical, but none can disagree that this module does indeed pack a lot more punch than previous models. It also needs a lot more power, but STEADLER is currently carrying out intense research work on why that is.

This was met with divided opinions, some criticizing C7 as taking the "booooring" route, others praising them for the innovation, while yet others reacted by shutting themselves in bunkers in anticipation of the time when these units will gain sentience and turn on their creators. C7 has vehemently denied any involvement in all sentient-AI-related catastrophes so far.

Kerbodyne engineers achieved this by running the engine in a staged combustion cycle and at extremely high chamber pressures. Special new alloys had to be invented to suppress the engine's tendency to become a bomb. The single version is designed with very durable components and high reusability, as well as higher gimbal range, but because of that is also heavier than its expendable counterpart used in first stage clusters.

Instead of relying on single engines or solid rocket boosters, the KR-1x2 employs two modified KR-1 engine, fed by a built-in fuel system, as the source of its immense lifting power. All that self-contained goodness comes at the cost of not having a mounting point for its underside, and not being quite as efficient as dedicated engines. It also comes at quite a literal cost as well.

The engineers couldn't get it to produce full efficiency at sea level without the engine exploding, so it was repurposed as an upper stage engine. The experience gained here with high efficiency has been repurposed for later models, which feature multiple combustion chambers at higher pressure (that don't go boom). This engine is optimized for lighting mid-flight, although it still provides respectable power at sea level.

		manufacturer = Kerbodyne
		description = Kerbodyne engineers got fed up with having to contend with overly complicated staging arrays for lifting heavy payloads, and decided instead to just build a truly enormous engine of the highest efficiency. Strapping together four of Kerbodyne's KS-25 rocket motors in a single assembly, they created the largest rocket engine in production anywhere, and each KS-25 has the highest chamber pressure--the reason for four small nozzles and combustion chambers, not one big one (those kept going boom). It's certainly got the power to match its size, and although it excels in its main role as a first-stage engine, the lack of structural hardpoints on its underside makes it quite less suitable for other purposes. Its price tag also seems to match its size, in fact.

Why not turn the rocket parts upside down and shake them? The grabbing arm perfectly filled this niche, and is quite capable of lifting heavy machinery. It has since found other uses, besides delicate tool extraction operations. AKA "The Klaw!"

			KerbinSrfLandedKSC = This is our Space Center. We're home.
			KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = Hey, I can see my house from here, I think.
			KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = It's very comforting to see that much green below you.
			KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = You get a great view of the highlands.
			KerbinFlyingLowMountains = The mountains rise up from the ground of Kerbin. They seem so much smaller from way up here.
			KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = The heat rising from the sand causes the desert to move and shimmer.
			KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = This looks like a bad place to land.
			KerbinFlyingLowTundra = You see patches of frozen grass. It looks like it's pretty cold out there.
			KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = You look down and see a sheet of shining white ice. If you stare at it too long your eyes start to water.
			KerbinFlyingLowShores = The shores look inviting and you watch the waves roll in to the coast.
			KerbinFlyingLowWater = From this perspective you can see the underwater topology.
			KerbinInSpaceLow = It seems we are very much in space right now. The sky seems to be mostly below us.
			KerbinInSpaceLow = Maybe if you get out and push...
			KerbinInSpace = It's very... round.
			KerbinInSpace = Crew reporting in, from space!
			MunInSpace = You look down at the cold gray surface. It looks really beat up with craters.
