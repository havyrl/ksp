Real Scale Boosters - Parts Pack

by Ed T. Toton III, aka NecroBones.


Required Dependencies:
	* Module Manager

Highly Recommended:
	* Hangar Extender
	* Kerbal Joint Reinforcement
	* Real Solar System
	* Community Tech Tree (if not playing in Sandbox mode)


Installation:

Simply copy the "RealScaleBoosters" folder into your GameData folder. If upgrading from a 
previous version, be sure to delete the old one from GameData first (this is the cleanest
option).


NOTE:
 
These rocket parts ARE NOT stock balanced! They're using the real world mass ratios,
thrusts, ISPs, dry weights, and so on.


Information:

This pack is intended for use with "Real Solar System", or otherwise a more realistic 
scale version of Kerbin. The parts included will likely be severe overkill in a more 
normal KSP installation.

This pack provides a variety of "Kerbalized" versions of real world boosters. These
are not meant to be true replicas. Where we've been able to get decent numbers for
the real world counterparts, we have tried to get the sizes, masses, fuel capacities
(in terms of mass), thrust, and ISP numbers close to correct. The art assets attempt
to capture the overall shape and look of their real counterparts, matching the colors
and dimensions, but perhaps not all of the details. Precision wasn't a requirement
in building this pack. Rather, it's meant to be closer to the "SpaceY" art style,
but functionally replicating real boosters.

You will also notice that this pack includes only the boosters, and not the payload
portions of these rockets. For example, the Saturn V parts are included from the bottom,
up to and including the third stage, but no Apollo spacecraft. The Space Shuttle parts
will build you a working LH/LOX tank and SRB combo, but does not have an Orbiter. The
idea is to build your own payload and use realistically performing analogs to the boosters 
used in the real world. To that end, some adapters and fairing parts are included so 
that other KSP parts will function with these boosters.

We hope you enjoy this pack. If you have any comments or feedback, please feel free to
send a private message to NecroBones on the KSP forums. Thanks!
