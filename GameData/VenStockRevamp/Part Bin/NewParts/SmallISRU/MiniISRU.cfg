manufacturer = Kerbodyne
description = A smaller version of Kerbodyne's mobile processing plant, this module can take raw materials containing even trace amounts of oxygen and hydrogen, and crack them into useful fuel products.  When operated by a skilled engineer, you will be able to operate with better efficiency.  This oddly shaped processor manufactures mono-propellant and nothing else, but is much lighter and smaller than the more versatile Convert-O-Tron 125.
